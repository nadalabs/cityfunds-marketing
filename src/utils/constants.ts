Cityfunds is conducting public offerings pursuant to Regulation A, as amended, through the Site and App. The offering circular for Cityfunds is available. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investments such as those on the Nada platform are speculative and involve substantial risks to consider before investing, outlined in the respective offering materials and including, but not limited to, illiquidity, lack of diversification and complete loss of capital. Key risks include, but are not limited to, limited operating history, limited diversification, risk of asset damage or theft and lack of voting rights. Also, the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unknown and could materially impact this investment.

From time to time, Cityfunds will seek to qualify additional series offerings of securities under Regulation A. For offerings that have not yet been qualified, no money or other consideration is being solicited and, if sent in response, will not be accepted. No offer to buy securities of a particular offering can be accepted, and no part of the purchase price can be received until an offering statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") relating to that series has been qualified by the SEC. Any such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time before notice of acceptance given after the date of qualification by the SEC. An indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind.`;

export const OUR_STORY = `
Nada is an investment, finance, and banking platform that has redefined how everyone accesses real estate assets.‍
Nada was founded on the belief that the financial system built around real estate assets was far too restrictive and unnecessarily complicated. We realized that the industry insiders and the wealthy had an unfair advantage. So, we set out to level the playing field by creating new financial products with transparency and simplicity built into every step.‍
Founded by a couple of non-conformists with the experience and grit to break down these barriers. Co-founder and CEO John Green spent his 20s as a full-time touring & recording punk rocker before his career leading risk and strategy within the mortgage industry. Co-founder and CFO Mauricio Delgado dropped out of Stanford to start his first company at 19 before launching a career spanning Wall Street as CEO of an auto fintech company.
Today, Nada is powered by a diverse group of talented and purpose-driven people who believe everyone deserves access to real estate wealth. We have created financial products enabling everyone to access home equity by investing as little as $250 in a single city or spending equity on a Visa® debit card. We're not just a company; we're a team of people who want to do good in the world.
